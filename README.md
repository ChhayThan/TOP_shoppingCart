## A project from the Odin project react course.

## Made with react

This project has helped me sharpen my skills in various areas of web development.
Here are some of the things I was able to use/do in this project:

- React data fetching and API use (useEffect)
- React routing (react-router + react-router-dom)
- Using react APIs - Hooks (useState, Context)
- Incorporated PropTypes
- Incorporated Material Design Icons using their components for icons
- Used CSS Modules to help with code organization

React Context, states, useLocation, useNavigation and Links are some major topics that I was able to learn and use in this project. (had to do a lot of trail and error and messing around with the application architecture as well as managing react states :\ )
